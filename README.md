## üìù Project Overview

This is a dynamic and interactive web application designed to help users easily track their daily calorie intake against a set budget. Whether you're aiming for a calorie deficit, surplus, or maintenance, this tool provides a clear overview of your nutritional journey.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Dynamic Entry Creation:** Effortlessly add multiple food and exercise entries under different meal categories (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Snacks, Exercise).
* **Real-time Food Search:** Search a predefined database of Nigerian foods with instant, debounced suggestions for quick and accurate calorie logging.
* **Intelligent Input Validation:** Ensures that calorie entries are valid numbers and provides user-friendly feedback for incorrect inputs.
* **Comprehensive Calorie Calculation:** Automatically calculates and displays total calories consumed, calories burned (from exercise), net calories, and highlights whether the user is in a `surplus` or `deficit` against their budget.
* **Entry Management:** Easily remove individual entries or clear the entire form with dedicated buttons.
* **Intuitive User Interface:** A clean, modern, and easy-to-navigate design that enhances the user experience.

## üíª Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For structuring the web content and semantically organizing the application.
* **CSS3:** Utilized for styling, creating a visually appealing and responsive user interface. Key CSS concepts applied include:
    * Custom Properties (`var()`) for consistent theming.
    * Flexbox for flexible and organized layout.
    * `box-sizing: border-box;` for predictable sizing.
    * `calc()` function for precise element positioning and sizing in complex scenarios (e.g., search results overlay).
* **JavaScript:** The core logic behind the application's interactivity and functionality, including:
    * DOM Manipulation for dynamically adding and removing elements.
    * Event Listeners for handling user interactions (clicks, input changes).
    * Array methods (`.filter()`, `.forEach()`) for data processing.
    * `setTimeout` and `clearTimeout` for implementing debouncing in the search feature, optimizing performance.

## üí° How to Use

1.  **Set Your Budget:** Enter your daily calorie budget at the top.
2.  **Add Entries:** For each meal category (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Snacks, Exercise):
    * Type a food name into the input field. Suggestions will appear.
    * Select a suggestion or enter your own food name.
    * Enter the calorie amount for that food/exercise.
    * Click "Add Entry" to add more items to that category.
3.  **Calculate:** Click the "Calculate Daily Calories" button to see your total intake and status.
4.  **Manage Entries:** Use "Remove Entry" to delete the last item in a category or "Clear Form" to reset everything.
